And that’s just the Last Resort. Enter the ScareScraper for 8-player local wireless** or online*** co-op gameplay. See if you can defeat all the ghosts, rescue all the toads, or clear other objectives before time runs out…in the ScareScraper! And for more mini-game madness, compete on teams at the ScreamPark!
